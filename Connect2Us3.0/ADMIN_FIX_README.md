# Admin Features Fix

## Issue
Admin-specific features were not visible or navigable when an administrator was logged in.

## Root Cause
The application was using Forms Authentication but lacked a proper role provider to handle role-based authorization. The `User.IsInRole("Admin")` checks in the layout were failing because role information wasn't available in the authentication context.

## Solution
Implemented a custom role provider (`Book2UsRoleProvider`) that:
1. Retrieves user roles from the database based on the authenticated username
2. Integrates with ASP.NET's role management system
3. Enables proper role-based authorization checks

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Custom Role Provider
- **File**: `Infrastructure/Book2UsRoleProvider.cs`
- Implements `RoleProvider` base class
- Queries the `ApplicationUsers` table to get user roles
- Provides `IsUserInRole()` and `GetRolesForUser()` methods

### 2. Updated Web Configuration
- **File**: `Web.config`
- Added role manager configuration with custom provider
- Enabled role-based authentication

### 3. Added Debug Information
- **File**: `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
- Added debug comments to help diagnose role checking issues

### 4. Added Test Endpoint
- **File**: `Controllers/AccountController.cs`
- Added `TestRoles()` action to verify role provider functionality

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Test with Pre-configured Admin User
1. Navigate to the login page: `/Account/Login`
2. Login with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@book2us.com`
   - Password: `Admin123!`
3. After successful login, you should see "Admin Panel" dropdown in the navigation bar
4. Click on "Admin Panel" to access admin-specific features:
   - Dashboard
   - Withdrawal Requests
   - Mock Withdrawal
   - Create Admin
   - Manage Users
   - Manage Orders
   - System Settings

### Method 2: Test Role Provider Directly
1. Login as any user
2. Navigate to: `/Account/TestRoles`
3. This will return JSON showing:
   - Authentication status
   - Current username
   - Role check results for Admin, Seller, Employee, Customer

### Method 3: Test with Different User Types
The database initializer creates test users for each role:
- **Admin**: admin@book2us.com / Admin123!
- **Seller**: seller@book2us.com / Seller123!
- **Employee**: employee@book2us.com / Employee123!
- **Customer**: customer@book2us.com / Customer123!

Each user type should see their respective navigation menus after login.

## Expected Behavior
After implementing this fix:
1. Admin users will see the "Admin Panel" dropdown menu
2. All admin-specific navigation links will be visible and functional
3. Role-based authorization will work throughout the application
4. The `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` attributes on admin controllers will function correctly

## Troubleshooting
If admin features are still not visible:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the user has "Admin" role in the database
3. Use the `/Account/TestRoles` endpoint to debug role checking
4. Ensure the web.config role manager configuration is correct
5. Check that the custom role provider is being loaded (no compilation errors)

## Database Schema
Ensure the `ApplicationUsers` table has a `Role` column that contains values like "Admin", "Seller", "Employee", or "Customer".

## Configuration Error Resolution

**Error**: `Could not load type 'book2us.Infrastructure.Book2UsRoleProvider'`

**Root Cause**: The Book2UsRoleProvider class existed but was not being compiled into the main assembly because the Infrastructure folder was not included in the project file.

**Solution Steps**:

1. **Added Infrastructure files to project compilation** in `book2us.csproj`:
   ```xml
   <Compile Include="Infrastructure\**\*.cs" />
   ```

2. **Fixed compilation errors** in Book2UsRoleProvider.cs by adding missing using statement:
   ```csharp
   using System.Linq;
   ```

3. **Updated Web.config** to include assembly name in type reference:
   - **Before**: `type="book2us.Infrastructure.Book2UsRoleProvider"`
   - **After**: `type="book2us.Infrastructure.Book2UsRoleProvider, book2us"`

The assembly name `book2us` was added to the type reference, which resolves the configuration loading error.
